# EthereumToDo
A simple TODO list built on the Ethereum network

Uses [truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle) and [ethereumjs-testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc)  


Run `truffle test` to run mocha tests.
Run `testrpc` to run the test network.  

If this was a serious project, many more libraries/frameworks/... would be used like:
- ui-router for angular routing  
- SASS for styles  
- ...
